# ChronoScio Backend [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chronoscio/backend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/interactivemap/backend) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/0074e97bc13b476ea3eec279483d3cab)](https://www.codacy.com/app/whirish/backend?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=interactivemap/backend&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Getting Started
We normally use [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) to simplify installation and configuration. Docker makes virtual "containers" as images which allow us to isolate code we run and work around computer-specific weirdnesses. Docker should work on [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) or [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) but requires Hyper-V, which is not available on Windows 10 Home edition. It does works on Windows 10 Pro 64 bit. If you have trouble with setting up Docker, see the **Local Development** instructions below instead. Otherwise, it should be simple to get started:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/chronoscio/backend

# Create env files, remember to update accordingly
mv django.env.sample django.env
mv postgres.env.sample postgres.env

# Build and start the docker containers
make run

# Navigate to http://localhost/, if you get a 502 error postgres likely has not been initialized yet,
#   try again in a few seconds
```
Use `make stop` or `make clean` to stop hosting when you are done.

## Local Development
1) Create a python virtualenv, activate it, and install the package requirements:
```bash
# Clone the repo if you have not already.
git clone https://github.com/chronoscio/backend

# Navigate to the backend repo.
cd backend

# Begin a virtual environmnet.
virtualenv venv

# Activate the virtual environment.
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the project requirements manually.
pip install -r config/requirements.txt

# Create env files and note that you will need to modify them later.
mv django.env.sample django.env
mv postgres.env.sample postgres.env
```
2) Create an SPA (Single Page Application) [here](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications).
3) Go to the Settings of your SPA put your Client ID and Client Secret into `django.env` along with the website domain.
```bash
API_IDENTIFIER={IDENTIFIER}
AUTH0_DOMAIN={DOMAIN}
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID={ID}
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET={Secret}
```
4) Install and run [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/tutorial-install.html) (AKA postgres) locally. You should not need to worry about creating any accounts. You will also need to make sure you have set up [geodjango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/contrib/gis/install/).  (TODO: Test this on wiped setups to find out specific steps to do this properly.)
5) Change the HOST variable in the [settings.py](https://github.com/chronoscio/backend/blob/master/project/interactivemap/settings.py) file to be `localhost` instead of `db` as you will be hosting locally. Set `AUTH0_DOMAIN` to `None` near the bottom of the file as well so that it is compatible with the other local hosting defaults. You may also need to change the PORT variable to match whatever you have set for postgis (TODO: investigate this).
6) Prepare a json dataset to be the database. For now, you can use our example test data.
```bash
cp docs/example_db_dump.json project/db.json
```
If this is the first time you are using django, you must also create a user account to log in with.
```bash
python project/manage.py createsuperuser
```
Then follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password you will use when you navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` later.
7) Migrate and run the server with django.
```bash
# Run SQL migrations.
python project/manage.py migrate

# Run the server.
python project/manage.py runserver
```
You should see a terminal output similar to this:
```bash
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
January 01, 2018 - 00:00:00
Django version 2.0.7, using settings 'interactivemap.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```
Then go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to see the Django administration panel. You should now be able to add Nations or Territories to the API and should see an Auth token after setting up your authetication (see developer guide). Try making an arbitrary Nation and then a Territory for that nation. Be sure to use the polygon outline tool when drawing on the Territory mapper. You will need to zoom out to see the world map properly as it starts fully zoomed in above the Atlantic Ocean (0, 0 coordinates).

## Architecture
config: Configuration files and requirements.

docs: Documentation and example database.

project/api/migrations: Auto-generated migration classes?

project/api: REST API and a test file (how/why do we run the test)?  Defines the Nation, Territory, and DiplomaticRelation classes, which are our primary database items.

project/interactivemap: Standard Django settings and website directory layout.

project: Standard Django aplication directory

Please refer to the [developer guide](./docs/DEVELOPER.md) and [contribution guide](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more about how we structure the backend. We try to centralize most important discussion in PRs and Issues.
